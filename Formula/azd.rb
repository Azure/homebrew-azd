      The #{desc} collects usage data and sends that usage data to Microsoft in order to help us improve your experience.
      You can opt-out of telemetry by setting the AZURE_DEV_COLLECT_TELEMETRY environment variable to 'no' in the shell you use.

      azd may download binaries to ~/.azd/bin and, depending on how azd was used on this machine,
      may download binaries to other users' home directories in their .azd/bin directory.
      These binaries will need to be removed manually upon uninstall.
      To remove such binaries from your home directory, run 'rm -rf ~/.azd/bin'.
